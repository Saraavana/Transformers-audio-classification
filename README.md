# Audio Classification using Transformer Model

In this project, I conducted audio classification on a diverse range of sounds including bark, raindrop, running, finger snapping, whispering, acoustic guitar, hi-hat, bass drum, and crowd cheering. By leveraging the power of Transformer models, I analyzed the intricate sound patterns and successfully classified each sound category with high accuracy. This approach allowed me to gain insights into the distinct characteristics and patterns of different audio samples, contributing to the broader field of audio analysis and classification.
